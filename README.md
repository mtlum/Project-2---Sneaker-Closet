# Project-2---Sneaker-Closet

This site allows a user to keep track of their sneaker collection. Users are able to add a sneaker into their collection by entering the make, model, colourway, release year and price they paid for the sneaker. Viewing individual sneakers allows the user to either delete it from their collection or marking it as either "sold" or "still in the collection".
